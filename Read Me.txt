Hello. This sample pack is compiled from my own sounds, used in my released and unreleased (yet) tracks. 

You can use the samples on your Volca Sample and within your DAW.
You may modify the samples however you want. 
You can make compositions with these samples and share them online.

You may NOT redistribute the samples, either as they are or modified.

If you want to share this sample pack with other people, please share the direct link to the download I've provided.

If you make something with these samples, you don't have to mention where they came from, although it'd be nice.

Also, feel free to let me know whenever you do anything with these samples, I'm curious what you'll be able to come up with. 

Enjoy the sample pack and have fun! 

Cheers,
Chaotrick.
